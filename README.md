To run the AT Weather App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Open the solution file (`ATWeatherApp.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution and run the application.
4. Start exploring weather forecasts for your favorite cities by typing in the name of the city and selecting from the dropdown.
5. Click on the blue bar to view more detailed information about the weather forecast in the selected city.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **C# Programming Language:** Powering the backend logic and UI interactions.
- **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF):** For creating rich desktop applications with modern UI.
- **Newtonsoft.Json:** Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- **HttpClient:** Making HTTP requests to the AccuWeather API for weather data.
- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm:** Implementing the MVVM architecture for clean and maintainable code.

## Integration Potential 🎮

Reason I chose a weather app and why it fits the profile:
Weather information can enhance gaming experiences by providing dynamic in-game weather effects or informing players about real-world conditions that affect gameplay. Building a weather app in WPF allows for easy integration with existing game engines or platforms (Interprocess Communication (IPC),Websockets), enabling seamless communication between the weather app and the game.
